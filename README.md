# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!
Small, simple project to practice Python programming, methodology, as well as git and github usage.

Just simple exercises done so far.
Trying to keep I/O and analysis separate.
Properly defined functions, trying to optimize them to the best of my own ability.
While the code is simple enough, it needs clearer sectioning and commenting, especially when expanding.

Project has been "finished".
Certainly can be played around with more, adding more content to local repository and tinkering with random selections. Adding more functions that lets you "search" the proverbial library, and present you with the information you specifically ask for - such things.
Could be fun to try and use it with web-operations. Maybe using 'Gutenberg Project' as the 'library' going off of data directly from that source. Sounds like it could be fun and useful practice.
